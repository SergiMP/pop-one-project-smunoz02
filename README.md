# pop-one-project-smunoz02

Project for POP I assignment.

I have been working regularly on the project for the past three weeks whenever work and family commitments allowed.
When pushing the code to GITHUB I realized that my previous GITHUB account has been linked to the one for the project.
I have seen in the forum that this can happen and that is ok, but in case there is an issue please let me know.
